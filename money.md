# Money in programming

How to deal with monetary values. [TL;DR](#conclusion).

Monetary values are problematic for (at least) three reasons:
[floats](#floats), [currencies](#currencies) and [i18n
(internationalization)](#i18n). Follow [these best practices](#best-practices)
to get a head start.

All monetary values in Paylike are both inputted and outputted as minor units
unless an explicit "exponent" is provided.

## Floats

Floats may cause issues because of the way computers represent them
internally. [Read more about that here](http://floating-point-gui.de/). For
instance:

```js
1 - 0.9 === 0.1
// false

1 - 0.9
// 0.09999999999999998
```

## Currencies

If you are used to USD or GBP you might (incorrectly) assume that

- ~All currencies have a major unit (e.g. dollars) and a minor unit (e.g. cents)~
- ~100 minor units are equal to 1 major unit~
- ~This never changes~

None are true. For instance the JPY does not have a minor unit (in most
systems), for the BHD 1 of the major unit is equal to 1000 of the minor unit,
and the HUF is moving from having a minor unit to not having one.

## I18n

Formatting (decimal) numbers is hard. Formatting monetary values is worse.

You have to consider:

- Numbers are formatted differently according to language and region (locale)
- Some currencies have symbols such as "€" for the euro and "¥" for the Japanese yen
- Some, like the Danish kroner (DKK), does not have a dedicated symbol, but is often shown with "kr."
- Depending on the language (and region) both the symbol and its position may vary

## Best practices

### Represent monetary values as minor units

Convert your monetary value into minors at least before doing arithmetic.

Dealing with minor units and inputting only integers as input, the following
operations can be considered safe (always results in an integer): addition,
subtraction and multiplication.

```js
// integers only

var sourceWallet = 650000
var targetWallet = 12699
var transactionAmount = 20000
var fee = 100

sourceWallet += -transactionAmount -fee
targetWallet += transactionAmount -fee

var feesCollected = fee * 2
```

Should you do computations that will inevitably result in floats (e.g.
currency conversion) you should conclude your computation with a rounding.

Operations with non-integers or division should make you think twice. Take
care not to make a mistake such as the following:

```js
// wrong

var billAmount = 10000
var participantsCount = 3

var amountPerParticipant = Math.round(billAmount / participantsCount)
```

In this case, the waiter will be "off-by-one" because they were only paid
$99.99. As the programmer, you have to make a decision on to how to resolve
this. Someone has to pay the last penny as it cannot be split any further. A
solution could be:

```js
// right

var billAmount = 10000
var participantsCount = 3

// Add tips of 20 %
var estimatedTips = billAmount * 0.2

var amountPerParticipant = Math.ceil((billAmount + estimatedTips) / participantsCount)
var tips = amountPerParticipant * 3 - billAmount
```

The tips are now being used as a buffer and the outcome is guaranteed to
result in whole minor units (integers). `ceil` is used to avoid a situation of
negative tips with very small amounts.

Why not use a decimal type or other built in language type? You might be able
to do that, at least for your database storage, but options and details vary
greatly between languages so it will require a higher awareness from your team
especially if you have code in more than one language.

#### Converting to minor units

Before you can represent money in minor units, you need to be able to convert
back and forth. To do so, you need to know how many minor units comprise a
major unit. Most systems (including banking ones) restrict this to be a factor
of 10 depending on the currency. This is called the "exponent". The exponent
is the factor of 10 that a single major is larger than a single minor. For
instance the USD has an exponent of 2 meaning you need `10^2 = 100` pennies to
have a dollar. The JPY has an exponent of 0 meaning 1 minor unit is equal to 1
major unit - in other terms, they are the same.

Here is a table showing some examples of how exponents work:

|                  | Major (float) | Minor (integer) |
|------------------|--------------:|----------------:|
| EUR (exponent 2) |        100.99 |           10099 |
| EUR (exponent 2) |           5.5 |             550 |
| JPY (exponent 0) |           100 |             100 |
| BHD (exponent 3) |       100.155 |         1001555 |
| HUF (exponent 2) |        100.50 |           10050 |
| HUF (exponent 0) |        100.50 |             100 |


You can find the exponents we use at Paylike on
https://github.com/paylike/currencies/blob/master/currencies.json.

Once you have decided on the exponent, converting from and to minor units is
trivial:

```js
var toMinor = (major, exponent) => round(major * pow(10, exponent))

var toMajor = (minor, exponent) => minor / pow(10, exponent)

var changeExponent = (minor, source, target) => toMinor(toMajor(minor, source), target)
// or
var changeExponent = (minor, source, target) => round(minor * pow(10, (target - source)))
```

Notice that there is a potential loss of data in the `toMinor` function if you
accept input that is more precise than what the exponent can accomodate. This
is one reason many financial systems accept input only in whole minor units.

### I18n

Unless you intend to make this your primary project, do not try to localize
the display of a monetary value yourself but use a library.

For JavaScript take a look at
[`Number.prototype.toLocaleString()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/toLocaleString):

```js
var amount = 1500.95

amount.toLocaleString('da-DK', {
	style: 'currency',
	currency: 'DKK',
})
// 1.500,95 kr.

amount.toLocaleString('en-US', {
	style: 'currency',
	currency: 'DKK',
})
// DKK1,500.95
```

In PHP the [`NumberFormatter`](http://php.net/numberformatter) class is
available.

Most languages have some built-in support for formatting money and many more
libraries exist to help out on this.

If correct formatting is impossible consider a fallback of `CCC #.##` (e.g.
"USD 100.00").

## Conclusion

Represent money in minor units (use conversion functions from [converting to
minor units](#converting-to-minor-units)) as integers and use libraries for
fomatting according to currency and locale (convert to major before passing
the amount).
